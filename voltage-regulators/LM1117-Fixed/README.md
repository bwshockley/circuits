#LM1117 Based Fixed Voltage Regulator#

The goal behind this particular voltage regulator was a low drop-out (LDO) fairly high current (800mAh) accurate voltage regulator.  The LM1117 is an improvement over the LM317.  For additional information on the LM1117, please see Texas Instrument's [LM1117 Datasheet](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lm1117-n.pdf).

The board is designed with a 2.54mm (.1") pitch for headers at the bottom.  It can be installed vertically with a 90deg header or horizontally with a straight header.

R1 and LED are optional - only if you want to have a visual indicator that the LM1117 is providing power.

LM1117 is in SOT-223 package.

C1 and C2 should be 10uF+ Tantalum Capacitors in 7343 (metric) package.  See additional requirements in the datasheet.
