#Voltage Regulators#

There are a number of different voltage regulators included here.  Most are lower power, 3.3v or 5v based regulators designed
to have minimal noise.  Useful for audio ICs, DACs, etc.

These were designed as drop in v-regs in various designs with a simple 2.54mm pitch 3 pin configuration (Vin-GND-Vout)
